            <p>Hi everyone! It's me, Mario.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio.</p>
            <p>If you look around you will see a simple and minimalistic (but well structured by components and modules) Single Page App. I did choose Angular because since I first meet the framework, I strongly believed that it will be my future tool to
                develop my frontend projects. It was easy to get along in the beggining, and it gives two benefits, its components are reusable and scalable.</p>
            <p>I know this website <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/021/work.jpg" target="_blank">isn't much, but it is honest work</a></p>

            <p>Jokes apart, I invite you to visit all the sections of my portfolio, specially <b>About</b> section, where you will find some information if you want to know me more; and <b>Work</b>, where you will see the mini-projects I have developed in
                my carreer.
